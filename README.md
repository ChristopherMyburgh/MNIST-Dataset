# MNIST-Dataset
Using Different Machine Learning models to identify and classify numbers

The MNIST dataset is a popular Dataset containing 60 000 images. 

For this task, I chose to use Random Forest Analysis and Logistic Regression Analysis.

I had undergone for both models just 1 parameter tuning. Each model consists of multiple parameters whereby a person may tune and process them, so my conclusion is not indicitive of a truly optimised model.

For each model, I conducted a Confusion matrix as well as a performance report that displayed each models Precision, Recall, F1-Score and Accuracy score.
